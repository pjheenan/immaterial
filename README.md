An exploration of Android design patterns and app design

### Environment


### Development
The majority of development work is done on the `dev` branch, this branch should always be ing a buildable state.

The `master` branch is a release only branch with the version numbers as `tags`

### Code Style
Please use the standard Android XML code setting in Android Studio or Intellij

Before committing please `reformat your code` and `optimize imports`. The IDE shortcut for this is `cmd + option + L`

Make sure your `Preferences -> File And Code Templates -> Includes -> File Header` is setup like below
```java
/**
 * @author ${USER} (your email address)
 */
```
